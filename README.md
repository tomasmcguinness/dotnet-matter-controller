# dotnet-matter-controller

This is my attempt at building a UI for building and controllering a Matter fabric. It's in the very early stages. It requires my dotnet-matter project to checked out too, since I'm using a project reference at this time.

You can add a single node (tested with matter.js example device node) via the console app in dotnet-matter. Once commissioned, you can launch the Matter.Controller project and the node should appear.

As I said, it's not intended for actual use yet.
